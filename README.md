# Nashville Helps Referral Tool
----
To run clone this repo and the [corresponding backend repo](https://github.com/katerebekah/NashvilleHelps_Api) into the following folder structure:

```
/nashvillehelps
	/client (this repo here)
	/api (other repo here)
```

If running locally, you'll need to run [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community) first. Then inside the api project, `npm run docs` to create your api documentation, then `node index.js` to run the application. If you go to `/api/docs` you'll see api documentation.
