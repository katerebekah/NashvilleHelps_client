# Nashville Helps Referral Tool

To run clone this repo and the [corresponding backend repo](https://github.com/katerebekah/NashvilleHelps_Api) into the following folder structure:

```
/nashvillehelps
	/client (this repo here)
	/api (other repo here)
```

If running locally, you'll need to run [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community) first. Then inside the api project, `npm install` and then `npm run docs` to create your api documentation, then `node index.js` to run the application. In order to get this side (the client side) working, run 'npm install' in the client folder. If you go to `/api/docs` you'll see api documentation.
